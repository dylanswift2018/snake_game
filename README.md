# Snake Game 
Snake is the common name for a video game concept where the player maneuvers a line which grows in length, 
with the line itself being a primary obstacle.      
After a variant was preloaded on Nokia mobile phones in 1998,     
there was a resurgence of interest in the snake concept as it found a larger audience.       
There are over 300 Snake-like games for iOS alone.

The player controls a dot, square, or object on a bordered plane. As it moves forward,      
it leaves a trail behind, resembling a moving snake. In some games, the end of the trail is in a fixed position,     
so the snake continually gets longer as it moves. In another common scheme, the snake has a specific length,      
so there is a moving tail a fixed number of units away from the head.         
The player loses when the snake runs into the screen border, a trail or other obstacle, or itself.
