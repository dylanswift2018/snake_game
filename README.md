# Snake Game 
Snake is the common name for a video game concept where the player maneuvers a line which grows in length, 
with the line itself being a primary obstacle. 
After a variant was preloaded on Nokia mobile phones in 1998, 
there was a resurgence of interest in the snake concept as it found a larger audience. 
There are over 300 Snake-like games for iOS alone.
